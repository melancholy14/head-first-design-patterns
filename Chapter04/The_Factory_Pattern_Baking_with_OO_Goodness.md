<!-- 
    •            Identifying the aspects that vary
    •            But the pressure is on to add more pizza types
    •            Encapsulating object creation
    •            Building a simple pizza factory
    •            Reworking the PizzaStore class
    •            The Simple Factory defined
    •            Franchising the pizza store
    •            We’ve seen one approach...
    •            But you’d like a little more quality control...
    •            A framework for the pizza store
    •            Allowing the subclasses to decide
    •            Let’s make a PizzaStore
    •            Declaring a factory method
    •            Let’s see how it works: ordering pizzas with the pizza factory method
    •            So how do they order?
    •            Let’s check out how these pizzas are really made to order...
    •            We’re just missing one thing: PIZZA!
    •            Our PizzaStore isn’t going to be very popular without some pizzas, so let’s implement them
    •            Now we just need some concrete subclasses... how about defining New York and Chicago style cheese pizzas?
    •            You’ve waited long enough. Time for some pizzas!
    •            It’s finally time to meet the Factory Method Pattern
    •            The Creator classes
    •            The Product classes
    •            Another perspective: parallel class hierarchies
    •            Factory Method Pattern defined
    •            A very dependent PizzaStore
    •            Looking at object dependencies
    •            The Dependency Inversion Principle
    •            Applying the Principle
    •            Inverting your thinking...
    •            A few guidelines to help you follow the Principle...
    •            Meanwhile, back at the PizzaStore...
    •            Ensuring consistency in your ingredients
    •            Families of ingredients...
    •            Building the ingredient factories
    •            Building the New York ingredient factory
    •            Reworking the pizzas...
    •            Reworking the pizzas, continued...
    •            Revisiting our pizza stores
    •            What have we done?
    •            More pizza for Ethan and Joel...
    •            From here things change, because we are using an ingredient factory
    •            Abstract Factory Pattern defined
    •            Factory Method and Abstract Factory compared
